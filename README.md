Hi! My name is Ermin and I am currently studying computer science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo. 
I'm a 20 y/o passionate programmer and code enthusiast. 
In this repository I will probably commit some interesting code/projects that I will try to do in my spare time or maybe even some tasks from my faculty
if i find them valuable. I will eventually (hopefully) have a pretty decent repository which I could actually include in my CV as well!.

For any messaging you can use my faculty email - ehadzic4@etf.unsa.ba
